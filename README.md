# RollDiceAndHoldGame-SimpleJSProject

Whichever player scores 100 points first will win the game.

The gameplay is as follows:
1.  You click on roll dice, and you will store the score in the current.
2.  If you roll 1, then the accumulated score in the current will be forfeited and the current player's turn will end.
3.  Hence don't be too greedy and click hold to add the accumulated score to the player's total score.
4.  Have fun!
